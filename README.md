# Block14-Loops-and-Arrays
Workshop - 14.

Welcome to this coding workshop! Today, we'll be completing four coding challenges using our knowledge of arrays, loops, and other JavaScript fundamentals.

To get started, we'll need to open up Visual Studio Code and create four new files named only-odd.js, vowel-vs-consonant.js, reverse-array.js, and fizzbuzz.js. These files will be used to write our solutions to the different prompts.

Next, we'll need to pseudocode a solution to each prompt before writing the actual JavaScript code. Pseudocoding will help us come up with a logical solution before we start coding, making the actual coding process much easier.

Once we have a solid pseudocode solution, we'll start writing the actual JavaScript code. As we code, it's important to console.log or debug our solution to make sure it's working as expected.

After we've confirmed that our solution is working correctly, we'll need to test all possible input values to make sure our solution is robust enough to handle any scenario.

Once we've tested all input values and confirmed that our solution works correctly, we can move on to the next prompt. Let's get started!
